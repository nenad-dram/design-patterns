# design-patterns

The intent of this project is to provide simple Java code examples for all GoF (Gang of Four) design patterns
(except the interpreter).

Patterns are split into three groups (directories): Creational, Structural and Behavioral patterns

Beside the code there are class diagrams for each example (/src/main/resources).

Unit tests are used as clients to demonstrate how to use, i.e. how to test all patterns.
