# design-patterns

### *WORK IN PROGRESS*
<br/>

The intent of this project is to provide simple Java code examples for all major (the most known) design patterns.

Beside the code there are class diagrams for each example (/src/main/resources).  

Unit tests are used as clients to demonstrate how to use, or test, "patternized" code.

More details will, probably, be added later.
